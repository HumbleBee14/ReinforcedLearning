# Actor-Critic Methods

> Combining the best of value-based and policy-based approaches

## The Idea

```
Actor:  The policy π(a|s) - decides what to do
Critic: The value function V(s) - evaluates how good the state is

Together: Actor proposes, Critic evaluates, both learn faster!
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Advantage Function (A = Q - V)

### 2. A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)

### 3. A3C (Asynchronous)

## Coming soon with P3 implementation...
