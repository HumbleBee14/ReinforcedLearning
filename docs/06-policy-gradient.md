# Policy Gradient Methods

> From value-based to policy-based RL - the foundation for LLM training

## Why Policy Gradient?

```
Value-Based (DQN):    Learn Q(s,a), derive policy as argmax
Policy-Based:          Learn π(a|s) DIRECTLY

LLMs ARE policies! π(next_token | context) = the LLM itself
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Policy Gradient Theorem

### 2. REINFORCE Algorithm

### 3. Baseline & Variance Reduction

## Coming soon with P3 implementation...
